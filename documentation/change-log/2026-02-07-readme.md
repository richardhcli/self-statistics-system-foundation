## Change: massive refactor: journal-architecture-plan

Phase 1 of the Journal refactor is complete: the journal store types are now normalized for the Firebase read-aside model, the ID generator schema is finalized, and feature-level type exports were updated to match the new entry and tree structures. The architecture guidelines were aligned with the hybrid read-aside philosophy to reflect Firebase as the source of truth with Zustand/IndexedDB as cache.

Phase 2 is complete: the Firebase journal service layer now implements tree subscriptions, month-range entry fetches using document ID prefixes, and batch write helpers for entry and tree updates.

Phase 3 is complete: the journal store now uses a normalized entry map with a lightweight tree index, cache metadata for TTL checks, and Firebase-backed month fetching, with UI components updated to read from the new tree + entry cache shape.
