# Graph Sync Debug Log - 2026-02-09

Status: FIXED

## Summary of Actions
- Forced CDAG structure fetch + subscription on app load and added detailed logs in `useCdagStructure`.
- Normalized manifest payloads to tolerate adjacency entries stored as strings or target/weight objects.
- Added a fallback path that fetches all nodes and edges when structure data is present but adjacency is empty.
- Introduced shared node/edge serializers and normalizers to standardize Firestore read/write formats.
- Added full-collection Firebase fetch helpers for nodes and edges.
- Updated documentation and change logs to reflect the hydration pipeline and debugging steps.

## Current Symptom
The UI still only renders the default node after app load. Logs show structure refreshes, but node and edge fetching does not populate the visual graph.

## Hypotheses
1. Firestore documents omit required fields (e.g., `id`, `source`, `target`) or have different casing than expected.
2. Structure document is missing adjacency data, preventing targeted fetches.
3. Auth UID used for fetch does not match the data owner.
4. Firestore rules block reads for graph subcollections.
5. Firestore data shape is correct but mapping into the store is failing or being overwritten.

## Plan of Action
1. **Verify raw Firestore data**
	- Use the debug panel to inspect `users/{uid}/graphs/cdag_topology/graph_metadata/topology_manifest`, `nodes`, and `edges`.
	- Confirm required fields and ensure edge IDs match `${source}->${target}`.

2. **Inspect fetch results in-app**
	- Add temporary logs for node/edge counts and sample payloads right after `fetchAllNodes`/`fetchAllEdges`.
	- Confirm normalized documents contain `id`, `source`, `target`, and `type`.

3. **Validate store hydration**
	- Verify `setStructure`, `cacheNodes`, and `cacheEdges` are executed.
	- Check for rehydration overwrites (IndexedDB merge vs. live updates).

4. **Confirm auth and security rules**
	- Ensure the UID used by the app matches the owner of the `cdag_topology` document.
	- Validate Firestore rules allow read access to graph subcollections.

5. **Compare with journal pipeline**
	- Ensure graph fetch uses the same authenticated user and read-aside workflow as journal entries.
	- Add parity logging for auth resolution and fetch timings.

## Summary of Fixes and Refactors
- **Structure fetch pipeline**: Forced structure fetch + subscription on app load, added telemetry to trace fetch counts and structure snapshots.
- **Schema normalization**: Standardized node/edge reads and writes with shared normalizers/serializers to guarantee `id`, `source`, and `target` integrity.
- **Fallback hydration**: Added a full-graph fallback when structure data is present but adjacency is empty.
- **Structure storage refactor**: Migrated lightweight topology data into a single manifest document at `graph_metadata/topology_manifest`.
- **Debug tooling**: Expanded debug snapshot to show the manifest document alongside nodes and edges.
- **Fetch minimization**: Full graph fetch occurs once per app load, then only when stale (30-minute TTL). The manifest refreshes on graph view focus.

## Current Status
- Structure snapshots now resolve correctly from Firebase.
- Full graph fetch runs on first app load and updates cache metadata.
- Manifest hydration now drives the structure without forcing full refetches.

## Remaining Verification Checklist
1. Confirm the manifest document contains node summaries and weighted adjacency after CRUD operations.
2. Verify `fullFetchAt` persists to IndexedDB and suppresses repeat full fetches within the TTL.
3. Ensure graph view re-entry only re-checks the manifest, not full node/edge fetches.




# Changes: 
Refactored the Neural Source of Truth (NSOT) architecture for the CDAG topology to improve synchronization reliability and performance. This overhaul migrates away from monolithic document storage with problematic dotted field keys toward a robust multi-collection structure and implements a session-scoped "Minimalist Fetch" strategy to optimize Firebase read operations.

Key Changes
1. Backend Architecture: Manifest Topology
Manifest Migration: Moved adjacency and summaries into a single manifest document at users/{uid}/graphs/cdag_topology/graph_metadata/topology_manifest.
Atomic Updates: Refactored graph-service.ts to utilize Firestore writeBatch for all graph CRUD operations. Every node/edge creation now atomically updates the primary node/edge document and the manifest topology.
2. Synchronization Pipeline: Minimalist Fetch Strategy
Session-Scoped Full Fetch: Implemented a "Full Fetch" policy that triggers only once per app session (via sessionFullFetchUid module state) or when the local cache exceeds a 30-minute staleness TTL.
Lightweight View Hydrography: Navigation to graph views now only triggers a synchronization of the manifest structure rather than re-fetching the entire node and edge collections.
Read-Aside Optimization: Reduced the reliance on real-time listeners for the entire graph, favoring a "Metadata Sync -> Structure Sync -> Detail Expansion" pipeline.
Forced Sync on Load: Added a guaranteed structure fetch + subscription on initial mount in useCdagStructure to ensure the visual graph is always grounded in the latest backend state.
3. Data Normalization & Integrity
Standardized Edge IDs: Centralized edge ID generation to the source->target format in graph-normalizers.ts, ensuring consistency between local lookups and Firebase keys.
Shared Normalizers: Introduced normalizeNodeDocument and normalizeEdgeDocument to guarantee that all Firestore reads include required fields (id, source, target, type) regardless of historical data variances.
Fallback Hydration: Added logic to verify adjacency data; if structure metadata exists but adjacency is missing, the system gracefully falls back to a full collection scan to rebuild the local store.
4. Debugging & Maintenance
Debug Dashboard Expansion: Updated the data-sync debug tools to visualize the manifest document in real-time.
Architectural Documentation: Updated cdag-topology.md and changelogs to reflect the manifest storage model.
Telemetry & Logging: Added detailed console telemetry to use-cdag-structure.ts to trace the reason for full-fetch triggers (session-start vs. stale vs. metadata-change).
Technical Details
Files Modified:
graph-service.ts: Refactored for multi-collection batch operations.
store.ts: Added fullFetchAt metadata and summary update logic.
use-cdag-structure.ts: Implemented TTL and session-based fetch logic.
graph-normalizers.ts: Unified ID and doc normalization.
datastore-sync.ts: Added visibility for new collections.
cdag-topology.md: Updated persistence architecture docs.

## Chat History Summary
- Root issue: Firestore data existed but the visual graph rendered only the default node after app load.
- Core fixes: Standardized edge IDs, normalized node/edge payloads, and ensured a full graph fetch runs once per session or after TTL expiration.
- Architecture shift: Replaced dotted-key structure fields with a manifest document and weighted adjacency entries.
- Debug path: Expanded debug tools to inspect manifest, nodes, and edges, then documented the hydration pipeline and verification steps.
