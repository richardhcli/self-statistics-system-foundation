# Change Log — 2026-02-04

Summary: Implemented a clean Google Sign-In flow with Firebase Auth, protected routing for the application view, and first-login Firestore user bootstrap. Legacy auth exports were removed in favor of the centralized provider, and login UI now provides basic error/submit feedback.
