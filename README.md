# Journal & Graph AI: The Neural Second Brain

Journal & Graph AI is a high-fidelity personal growth platform that transforms unstructured thoughts and voice recordings into a structured, hierarchical knowledge base. It leverages the **Google Gemini API** to classify human effort and visualizes progress through a stable **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy & Mechanics

### 1. The 3-Layer Semantic Pipeline
The application organizes knowledge into three distinct functional layers, styled as a real-life RPG status system:
- **Actions (Emerald #10b981)**: Granular activities extracted from journal entries (e.g., "Debugging", "Squats").
- **Skills (Amber #f59e0b)**: Intermediate competencies that encapsulate groups of actions (e.g., "Frontend Engineering").
- **Characteristics (Indigo #4f46e5)**: High-level human traits representing fundamental potential (e.g., "Intellect", "Vitality").

### 2. The 7 Archetypal Attributes
The system defines seven core attributes that serve as gravity wells for skill classification:
**Vitality**, **Intellect**, **Wisdom**, **Social**, **Discipline**, **Creativity**, **Leadership**.

The AI is encouraged — but never forced — to map skills toward these hubs. Organic, emergent characteristics are preserved when they don't cleanly fit.

### 3. Adaptive Neural Weighting
The "Brain" is dynamic. Gemini suggests weights for relationships; the system uses a **Learning Rate (0.01)** to adjust existing edge weights over time, allowing the hierarchy to adapt to your evolving habits.

### 4. Cumulative EXP Propagation
Effort is quantified as EXP and propagated using **Path-Weighted Cumulative Averaging**:
- EXP flows upward from Actions to Characteristics.
- Normalization prevents "Domain Inflation," ensuring root attributes reflect average intensity across sub-trees.

### 5. Logarithmic Level Curve
Levels are computed via `Level = floor(log2(EXP + 1))`, providing rapid early leveling that tapers at higher tiers. All EXP values are rounded to 4 decimal places for consistency.

## 🛠 Application Views

### 📔 Journal
A hierarchical feed (Year > Month > Day) for voice and text ingestion. Features detailed "Neural Impact Analysis" for every entry, showing exactly where your effort went. Includes a **Canvas-based Oscilloscope** for real-time voice feedback during recording. Firebase is the source of truth; local IndexedDB provides fast boot and offline reads.

### 🕸 Concept Graph (Visual Source of Truth)
A stable, interactive DAG visualization designed for semantic clarity and structural persistence. Supports multi-node selection, relationship path highlighting, and **Ultra-Rigid position snapping** for a deterministic UX. Hydrates from IndexedDB on boot, then force-refreshes from Firebase.

### 📊 Statistics (RPG Character Sheet)
A four-tab dashboard displaying the player's progression:
- **Status**: 7-axis radar chart of core attributes, attribute grid cards with level + progress bars, recent neural impact (last 5 entries), and skill clusters grouped by characteristic.
- **Experience**: Top 10 nodes ranked by cumulative EXP.
- **Levels**: Global level badge, XP progress bar toward next level, and top 3 contributor nodes.
- **All Statistics**: Summary metrics (total EXP, node/edge counts, highest EXP node).

Tracks daily and yesterday's EXP deltas via hierarchical journal tree metadata.

### ⚙️ Settings & Integrations
A persistent Discord-style interface for managing profile metadata and external connections:
- **Status Display**: Class title and visibility toggles.
- **Account Profile**: Firestore-backed display name editor with Google account details and logout.
- **AI Configuration**: Fine-tune classification temperature, model selection, and transcription feedback.
- **Privacy & Notifications**: Encryption, visibility, and notification preferences.
- **Data Portability**: Full JSON Backup & Restore of the IndexedDB state.
- **Webhooks**: Real-time JSON broadcasts of processed entries.
- **Obsidian**: Local REST API integration to sync entries as Markdown notes.

### 🛠 Debug Console
Low-level access to the application engine. Features batch data injection (AI, Manual, Complex, and Brain datasets), an experience injector for math verification, a raw data browser for IndexedDB inspection, a force-sync panel for reconciling local and backend state, and session authentication diagnostics.

## 🏗 Technical Stack & Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19 (Vite 6) + TypeScript ~5.8.2 (Bulletproof Architecture).
- **State**: Zustand 5 (Global) + IndexedDB via `idb-keyval` (Persistence).
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore) — Hybrid Read-Aside, Sync-Behind.
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini (`gemini-3-flash-preview` → `gemini-2.0-flash` fallback).
- **Visuals**: D3.js v7 with stable hierarchical layouts + Recharts for statistical charts.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + Lucide React icons.
- **Connectivity**: PWA-ready with Service Worker and Manifest support.
- **Progression System**: Centralized in `src/systems/progression/` — propagation engine, EXP scaling, logarithmic level curve, and 7 core attribute definitions. Aliased as `@systems/progression`.
- **Topology Logic**: Graph merging, classification, and topology utilities in `src/lib/soulTopology/`.
